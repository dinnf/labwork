// A WeakMap is a collection of key/value pairs whose keys must be objects, 
// with values of any arbitrary JavaScript type, and which does not create strong references to its keys. 
// That is, an object's presence as a key in a WeakMap does not prevent the object from being garbage collected. 
// Once an object used as a key has been collected, its corresponding values in any WeakMap become candidates for 
// garbage collection as well â€” as long as they aren't strongly referred to elsewhere.
